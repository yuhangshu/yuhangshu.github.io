Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Developmental Psychology at the University of Virginia, advised by Dr. Amrisha Vaish. I study how children make sense of an unequal world. My research focuses on how children’s socioemotional responses, such as prosocial behavior and trust, are shaped by their experiences of inequality, and how their perceptions of fairness moderate these effects.

I’m also interested in how children reason about and justify inequality: how they think about merit, need, social group membership, and structural factors. More broadly, I explore how these beliefs and behaviors are shaped by cultural norms and socialization.

I expect to complete my Ph.D. in 2026 and am currently seeking a postdoctoral position in developmental psychology
